# Day 1 – Problem Framing: Transfer ROI Analyzer

## Why this project?
I’m passionate about using data to influence football strategy. This project helps me apply analytics to real-world club decisions.

## Goal:
Estimate if a transfer was worth the investment using player performance and resale value.

## Scope:
- League: English Premier League
- Seasons: 2021–22 and 2022–23
- Sample size: 10–15 high-profile transfers

## Initial ROI idea:
ROI = (Performance Score + Resale Value) / Transfer Fee  
Performance Score = Goals + 0.5 × Assists + 0.1 × Starts

## Next step:
Collect raw data (Transfer fee, Age, Goals, etc.) for selected players tomorrow.
