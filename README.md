## Day 1 – Problem Framing: Transfer ROI Analyzer

**Why this project?**  
I'm passionate about football strategy and data science. This project helps bridge both by modeling what makes a signing "worth it."

**Who is this for?**  
A football club’s data/scouting/recruitment team — to evaluate past transfers and improve future decisions.

**What do I hope to learn?**  
- Data merging and cleanup  
- Feature engineering (creating "value" from raw stats)  
- Framing decisions from a technical director's point of view  
- Building visuals that speak to football executives

**Initial Ideas for ROI Formula:**  
ROI = (Performance Score + Resale Value if sold) / Transfer Fee  
Performance Score = Goals + (0.5 × Assists) + (0.1 × Starts) → *to be refined*

**Next Step (Day 2):**  
Build an initial dataset of 10–15 players and start collecting fees + appearances, goals, etc.
